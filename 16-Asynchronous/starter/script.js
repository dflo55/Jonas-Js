// 246. Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAx, APIs
// synchronous code - most code is synchronous
// - it is executed line by line
// - each line of code waits for previous line to finish
// - (bad) long running operations block code execution
// asynchronous code - is executed after a task
// that runs in the "background" finishes
// - it is non-blocking meaning main code is not being blocked and
// execution doesnt wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work
// - asynchronous coding is coordination behavior of a program over a period of time
// - Callback functions does not make code asynchronous
// - addEventListener does not make code asynchronous
